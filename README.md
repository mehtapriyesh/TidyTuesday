# TidyTuesday
This rep is created to work on my data analysis skills with R and Python. 
I will be using datasets from Tidy Tuesday Project. 

Here, firstly I will be using my own ideas to get started with some random dataset in either of the two languages. This will be followed by trying to explore some other useful questions as explained by other experts.
